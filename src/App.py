        An A/B test was set into motion from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017 by the team.

        Control Group: Clients interacted with Vanguardâ€™s traditional online process.

        Test Group: Clients experienced the new, spruced-up digital interface.

        Both groups navigated through an identical process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and finally, a confirmation page signaling process completion.

        Goal: To see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.
